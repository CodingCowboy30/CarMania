Backend Methods and Integration
API Endpoints
GET /cardata: Fetch all cars.
GET /cardata/
: Fetch a specific car by ID.
POST /cardata: Add a new car.
PUT /cardata/

Middleware and Routing

Express.js: Used for setting up the server and API endpoints.

Mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB and defining car schemas.
Integration with Frontend

axios: Used in React components to make HTTP requests to the backend API for fetching and manipulating car data.
Context API: Used for state management and sharing data across components.
Learning Curve with MUI
Component-Based Design: MUI provides a wide range of pre-built components, making UI development faster and more consistent.
Styling: MUI uses a CSS-in-JS approach, allowing for dynamic and scoped styling.
Theming: Easy to customize and apply global styles using MUIâ€™s theming capabilities.
Responsive Design: Built-in support for responsive design ensures the app looks good on all devices.
Conclusion
Carr Mania leverages the power of modern web development tools and libraries to create a seamless user experience. This project serves as a valuable learning experience in integrating a sophisticated frontend with a functional backend, utilizing MUI for efficient and effective UI development. The skills and methodologies applied here are foundational for future projects and professional growth in web development.
